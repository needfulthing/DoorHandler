# DoorHandler v3

This is the third version of the Door Handler. For previous development steps see my instructables "The Door Handler" and "The Door Handler v2".

Improvements:
- The lids are a bit larger and fit better over the jaws now.

- The lid's rubber band slots moved a bit to the back to reduce tension when using a 60mm rubber band.

- Hot glue is used on the inner of the jaws to add a smooth and grippy surface.

- Added 3D objects for a pocket holder. Four 6 x 2.8mm Neodym magnets are required for the pocket holder and the handler itself.

- Added left hand and right hand version so you can wear it on both sides.

I consider this the first version which might be really usable. Though I don't feel the urge to make the design more complicated a version with UV integrated LEDs roams in my mind. Maybe I will go for it the next days.

# Printing

Print all the parts, which is one handler (left or right), one handler holder (left or right), both lids and one pocket holder clip. Choose either left hand or right hand version for the handler and the handler holder.

Print settings:

- 0.4 mm nozzle

- 0.15 mm layer height

- 15% Gyroid infill

- a brim is recommended

- I used PLA for these prints

# Add Grip

Add hot glue to the inner area of the jaws. Try to make a smooth grip surface.

# Add Rubber Band

Thread the rubber band trough the holes on both lids as shown in the picture.

# Mount Screw

Align the band over the thumb rest, then move the lid screw holes over the mounting hole of the front jaw. Attach the screw. To avoid that the nut loosens though usage you can put some glue on the screw/nut junction.

# Attach Magnets

Push two magnets into the holes of the handler holder and two magnets into the associated holes of the handler grip.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Check the polarity of the other two magnets before pushing them in, so that both magnet pairs attract each other properly!

IMPORTANT NOTE 2: The pictures still show a prototype with only two magnets, but I found out that one pair didn't make the handler stick firm enough to the holder. The 3D files already include another magnet hole pair.

# Hot Glue the Holder and Clip.

Hot glue the handler holder to the holder clip.
